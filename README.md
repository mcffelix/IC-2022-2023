 DSP and FPGA-based platform for controlling power converters

 Implementation of a multilevel PWM modulation scheme (using the Phase-Shift technique) for a converter with three H-bridges in cascade, resulting in seven voltage levels. The modulation signals were developed using VHDL (hardware descriptive language). The modulator was   
 implemented on a DE0-nano board (with Altera/Intel FPGA). Experimental results of the control signals were presented for the respective converter.
